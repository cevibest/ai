Group A (Any 4) (Based on Machine intelligence for Data Science)
Assignment 1: Access an open source dataset “Titanic”. Apply pre-processing techniques on the raw 
dataset. 
Assignment 2: Text classification for Sentimental analysis using KNN. (Refer any dataset like Titanic, 
Twitter, etc.) 
Assignment 3: Write a program to recognize a document is positive or negative based on polarity 
words using suitable classification method.
Assignment 4: Download Abalone dataset. (URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) 
a) Predict the number of rings either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. 
b) Predict the age of abalone from physical measurements using linear regression 
Assignment 5: We have given a collection of 8 points. 
P1=[0.1,0.6] 
P2=[0.15,0.71] 
P3=[0.08,0.9] 
P4=[0.16, 0.85] 
P5=[0.2,0.3] 
P6=[0.25,0.5] 
P7=[0.24,0.1] 
P8=[0.3,0.2]
Perform the k-mean clustering with initial centroids as m1=P1 =Cluster#1=C1 and 
m2=P8=cluster#2=C2. 
Answer the following 
1] Which cluster does P6 belong to?
2] What is the population of cluster around m2? 
3] What is updated value of m1 and m2?
